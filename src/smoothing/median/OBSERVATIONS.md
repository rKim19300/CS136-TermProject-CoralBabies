- Below are observations purely based on visual observations.
- The Median smoothing filter was applied on three sets of images: the base images, histogram equalization, and CLAHE, which builds upon histogram equalization
- I will be evaluating the effects of the Median smoothing filter set to a 5x5 frame on these three sets of images

The Median smoothing filter seems to be somewhat promising. My main point of evaluation are the voids that appear to correlate with the presence of coral babies. The effect of the median filter is to eliminate much of this noise, which I imagine would make it easier for future feature analysis.
