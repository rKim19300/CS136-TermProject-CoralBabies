### Explanation

- Targeted Adaptive Histogram Equalization (TAHE) applies histogram equalization to only
  the coral colonies based on a component map.
- It works under the assumption that Prof. Heller's AI algorithm will
  map the colonies a similar way that we did
- The supposed benefits of TAHE are:
  - **Noise reduction**: The noise around the colonies don't get intensified, 
    likely reducing noise. Furthermore, the noise doesn't get added to the equalized 
    histograms of the colonies.
