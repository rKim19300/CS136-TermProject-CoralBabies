# CS136-TermProject-CoralBabies

## Project Structure

### Directories

- **dataset**: Holds the original dataset

- **labeled_data**: Holds the manually labeled dataset with the coral spawn circled and counted

- **src**: Holds the images with different computer vision algorithms applied
           and the observations of those applications.

  - **contrast**: Holds the images with the contrast algorithms applied and their observations. 
                  The main base of this project, as we are trying to find the contrasting algorithm that would best
    - **Histogram Equalization**: The samples with histogram equalization applied.  
<br>
  - **NOTE**: For each of the next directories below each subdirectory contains inner directories with the contrasted 
              it is being applied to.
